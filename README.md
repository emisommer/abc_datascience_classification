This repository explores fundamental classification algorithms in machine learning and provides practical examples of their implementation. Classification is the task of assigning data points to pre-defined categories or classes, making it essential for many applications.

**Why Classification Matters**

* **Email Spam Detection:** Identify whether an email is spam or legitimate.
* **Medical Diagnosis** Predict the presence or absence of a disease based on patient symptoms
* **Image Classification:** Recognize objects in images (e.g., cat vs. dog classification)
* **Customer Churn Prediction:** Determine the likelihood of a customer leaving a service 

**Algorithms**
This repository covers the following widely-used classification algorithms:

1. **Decision Tree:** Builds a tree-like structure of rules to make predictions.

2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** Classifies a new data point based on the majority vote of its 'k' nearest neighbors.

3. **Kernel SVM:**  A powerful extension of Support Vector Machines, using kernels to handle non-linearly separable data.

4. **Logistic Regression:**  Models the probability of a data point belonging to a class using a logistic function.
This is a way to explain what binary classification is by using linear and logistic regression.

This is another way of showing how logistic regression classifies two classes.

5. **Naive Bayes:**  Applies Bayes' theorem for classification, based on the assumption of independence between features.

6. **Random Forest:**  Combines multiple decision trees to improve predictions and reduce overfitting.
Random forest is a variation of decision tree, where lot of trees are serving and composing the forest.

7. **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** Finds the best-fitting hyperplane to separate data points belonging to different classes.
