This repository explores fundamental classification algorithms in machine learning and provides practical examples of their implementation. Classification is the task of assigning data points to pre-defined categories or classes, making it essential for many applications.

**Why Classification Matters**

* **Email Spam Detection:** Identify whether an email is spam or legitimate.
* **Medical Diagnosis** Predict the presence or absence of a disease based on patient symptoms
* **Image Classification:** Recognize objects in images (e.g., cat vs. dog classification)
* **Customer Churn Prediction:** Determine the likelihood of a customer leaving a service 

**Algorithms**
This repository covers the following widely-used classification algorithms:

1. **Decision Tree:** Builds a tree-like structure of rules to make predictions.

2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** Classifies a new data point based on the majority vote of its 'k' nearest neighbors.

3. **Kernel SVM:**  A powerful extension of Support Vector Machines, using kernels to handle non-linearly separable data.

4. **Logistic Regression:**  Models the probability of a data point belonging to a class using a logistic function.

5. **Naive Bayes:**  Applies Bayes' theorem for classification, based on the assumption of independence between features.
6. **Random Forest:**  Combines multiple decision trees to improve predictions and reduce overfitting. [Image of multiple decision trees in a random forest]
7. **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** Finds the best-fitting hyperplane to separate data points belonging to different classes.

**Jupyter Notebooks: Step-by-Step Learning**

Each algorithm has a dedicated Jupyter Notebook, including:

* **Theoretical Explanations:**  Understand the intuition behind each algorithm.
* **Code Implementations:**  Learn how to implement models in Python.
* **Examples on Datasets:**  Apply the algorithms to real-world classification problems.

**Designed For:**

* **Beginners:** New to machine learning seeking to understand classification.
